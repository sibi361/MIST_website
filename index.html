            He spiked his hair green to support his iguana. He dreamed of
            leaving his law firm to open a portable dog wash. He found a
            leprechaun in his walnut shell. Italy is my favorite country; in

            good example of a useful vegetable is medicinal rhubarb. At that
            moment she realized she had a sixth sense. Flesh-colored yoga pants
            were far worse than even he feared. She was sad to hear that
            fireflies are facing extinction due to artificial light, habitat
            loss, and pesticides.
